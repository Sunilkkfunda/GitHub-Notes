step 4: create a repository


   private: https://github.com/bsnl-4g-test/testing-private-repo

   public repo: https://github.com/bsnl-4g-test/testing-public-repo


step 5: create a team


    dev : bsnl-dev-team

    DevOps : bsnl-DevOps-Team



step 6: add users to team(dev, DevOps, SRE, QA, DB, etc)


step 7: give repo access to team..

Git commands
—-----------------

step 0: pls install gitbash

Why DevOps Engineer required git?
—--------------------------------
Ans: As a DevOps Engineer , we need to write few scripts, YAML files.

IDE [Integrated Development Environment]
----
Eclipse
Myeclipse
Intellij

VS code
Pycharm
Atom

Untracked files:
Working area              staging area                 local repo
—----------------         —-------------              —-----------

git status
—--------
To see the status of files

Vi Test3.java

Before commit
-------------

git config --global --list  —-> Too see the uname and mail id.

git config --global user.name "kkdevopsonline"
git config --global user.email  "prasanthdevops123@gmail.com"


→git add .
→git add *
→ git add Filename1 Filename2
—> git add *.java
—> git add *.py


How to see the commit history?

→ git log 
→ git log -2  [To see the last 2 commits] or git log -n 2



How to see many repos are mapped?

git remote -v --> to see the alias name

How to connect to a remote repository?

→ git remote add jio(aliase name) <repo url>
→ git remote add jio https://github.com/kkdevopsonline/test.git

→ git push jio master

NOTE: Generate a PAT : 


IQ: Is it possible to remove alias name?
Ans: Yes

     git remote remove jio

  


IQ] How to move files from working area to local repo directly?

ANS: git commit -a -m “updated code”
NOTE: for new file it is not possible

IQ: Where the credentials are stored ?
Ans: for windows → credentials manager
         For MAC     —> KeyChainAccess

IQ: How many files committed for one commit how to see?

ANS: git show commit_id
   —>    git show --pretty="" --name-only 93bc19a84166ce6ff1ad4e230f990ca05caf0150 [use this in real time]


DAY 3
-----

what is the diff between git add . and git add * ?

IQ: How to remove the working area files?
ANS:  git clean -n [ It will display what are the files are to be deleting]
         git clean -f [Forcefully we are deleting]
NOTE: only new files will be deleted, Not Modified one.

IQ: Is it possible to move files from stg area to working area?
 ANS: git reset [all files will be moved.
          git reset <filename> [only particular file will move]

IQ: Due to your bad commit , application is not working, pls revert back the changes How?

git revert <commit id>   —> It will delete all changes in local repo only not in the remote repo.

IQ: How to delete an updated code in remote repo?
      
       Already we deleted updated code in my local, Now you can push all files.
    git push jio-dev master

IQ: what is the diff b/w git reset and git revert?

Git reset —> stg to working
Git revert → from new commit, it will delete new file and updated contents in another file.


What is a .gitignore file?

If you are not interested to move any file, Then keep that file name inside .gitignore file


How many environments?
—--------------------------------

Dev branch —> development
Stg branch  —-> QA
Master branch      —-> prod
Release branch —-----> prod
Feature branch  


NOTE: By default we have master branch, we are not suppose to push code directly into the master branch.

git branch —-> List the branches, create, delete and rename the branches.

How to list branch names?

git branch

How to  create a branch?

git branch <branch name>

How to switch from one branch to another branch?

git checkout <branch name>


DAY 4
=====

How many environments?
—--------------------------------

Dev branch —> development
Stg branch  —-> QA
Master branch      —-> prod
Release branch —-----> prod
Feature branch  


NOTE: By default we have master branch, we are not suppose to push code directly into the master branch.

git branch —-> List the branches, create, delete and rename the branches.

How to list branch names?

git branch

How to  create a branch?

git branch <branch name>

How to switch from one branch to another branch?

git checkout <branch name>

Explain the merging concept
=======================

Step 1: go to development branch from master, git checkout development.
  NOTE: By default all the files of master branch moved to development branch becz we created dev branch from master branch.

Step 2: Take one file and update in the dev branch and do the commit.

Step 3: come back to master and check the file is updated or not, It will not updated.

Step 4: from master —> git diff development
Step 5: from master —> git merge development
Step 6: see the file is merged or not.


What is merge conflict?

When two developers are updating same file and same line, Then we are getting merge conflict.

Step 1: update the file in master branch and commit the changes.

Step 2: update the same file in development branch and commit the changes.

Step 3: goto master , apply git merge development

Step 4: remove the unused lines and then commit the changes.


How to switch a branch, while creating it self?

Git checkout -b stage

How to push all branches from local repo to remote repo?

Git push <alis name> branch1 branch2
Git push <alias name> –all

How to create a branch in a remote repo?

Ans: Go and create in remote repo


How to get updated code from remote branch?

Git pull <alias name> branch name

How to see the remote branches?

Git branch -r


How to see all the branches(local and remote)?

Git branch -a



How to rename branch?

git branch -m old new

How to delete a branch in local repo?

Git branch -d <branchname>  —-> Current pointing branch will not be deleted.


How to delete remote repo branch from local?

Git push <alisas name>  : <branch name>



DAY 5
=====

What is the diff b/w branch and tag?
Branch
—-------
Mutable
Creating while development going on
Creating the branches from another branches also.
Git branch [list the branches]
Git branch <name>   [to create a branch]
Git push aliasName Branchname
Git push aliasName --all
Git branch -d branchname


Tag
—-
Immutable
Creating after production deployment
Creating  a tag mainly from master branch
Git tag [List the tags]
Git tag tagName [create a tag]
Git push alias tagName
Git push aliasName --tags
Git tag -d tagname

Step 1: git tag
Step 2: git tag Airtel_V1.0.0[major, minor, patch] —-> create it from master.
Step 3: git tag
Step 4: git push airtel Airtel_V1.0.0

NOTE: tag files always showing in zip and tar


IQ: How to create a tag in remote repository?

Goto tag→create release —> create a tag —-> ……..


Git stash
—---------

When we are working on one task on dev branch, Immediately we got an issue in prod(master), we need to switch.

Step 1: take the working area backup of dev.
     
            git stash save “login feature”
Step 2: see the list of backup.
 
            Git stash list  → stash@{0}, stash@{1} —--

Step 3: go to master branch and finish the work and come back.

Step 3: use the backup to get the data.
      Git stash apply stash@{1}






IQ: In my local repo , size is increasing , How to proceed to reduce that?

Ans: Need to delete all stash files which are not using.
  
Git stash drop —-> by default recent will be deleted.
Git stash drop stash@{5} —> specific one deletion.

NOTE: git stash pop [apply and delete]

git stash clear  —> delete all the stashes at once





How to restore the working area changes?

step 1: wrongly updated file in working area.

step 2: git restore <fileName>
