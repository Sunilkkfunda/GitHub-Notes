git config --global user.name "kkdevopsonline"
git config --global user.email  "prasanthdevops123@gmail.com"


→git add .
→git add *
→ git add Filename1 Filename2
—> git add *.java
—> git add *.py


How to see the commit history?

→ git log 
→ git log -2  [To see the last 2 commits] or git log -n 2



How to see many repos are mapped?

git remote -v --> to see the alias name

How to connect to a remote repository?

→ git remote add jio(aliase name) <repo url>
→ git remote add jio https://github.com/kkdevopsonline/test.git

→ git push jio master

NOTE: Generate a PAT : 


IQ: Is it possible to remove alias name?
Ans: Yes

     git remote remove jio

  


IQ] How to move files from working area to local repo directly?

NOTE: for new file it is not possible

IQ: Where the credentials are stored ?
Ans: for windows → credentials manager
         For MAC     —> KeyChainAccess

IQ: How many files committed for one commit how to see?

ANS: git show commit_id
   —>    git show --pretty="" --name-only 93bc19a84166ce6ff1ad4e230f990ca05caf0150 [use this in real time]

—--------------------------------

Dev branch —> development
Stg branch  —-> QA
Master branch      —-> prod

Feature branch  


NOTE: By default we have master branch, we are not suppose to push code directly into the master branch.

git branch —-> List the branches, create, delete and rename the branches.

How to list branch names?

git branch

How to  create a branch?
